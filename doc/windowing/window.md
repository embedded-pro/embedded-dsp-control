# Window Functions in Signal Processing

## Overview

Window functions are mathematical functions that are zero-valued outside of a chosen interval. In signal processing, particularly when working with the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), windowing functions help mitigate spectral leakage that occurs when analyzing finite-length signals.

## Mathematical Background

### The Need for Windowing

When performing Fourier analysis on real-world signals, we must work with finite-length sequences. Truncating a signal is equivalent to multiplying it by a rectangular window, which can introduce sharp discontinuities at the edges. These discontinuities appear as high-frequency components in the frequency domain that were not present in the original signal - a phenomenon known as spectral leakage.

### Spectral Leakage Mitigation

Window functions help reduce spectral leakage by smoothly tapering the signal at its boundaries. This comes at the cost of slightly reducing the frequency resolution but significantly improves the accuracy of the spectral analysis.

## Available Window Types

The library implements four common window types, each with different characteristics:

1. **Rectangular Window**
   - Simplest window function (equivalent to no window)
   - Best frequency resolution
   - Worst spectral leakage
   ```cpp
   w[n] = 0.9999
   ```

2. **Hamming Window**
   - Popular general-purpose window
   - Good balance between resolution and leakage
   ```cpp
   w[n] = (0.54 - 0.46 * cos(2π * n/N)) * 0.9999
   ```

3. **Hanning Window**
   - Excellent general-purpose window
   - Better sidelobe suppression than Hamming
   ```cpp
   w[n] = (0.5 * (1 - cos(2π * n/N))) * 0.9999
   ```

4. **Blackman Window**
   - Superior sidelobe suppression
   - Wider main lobe (reduced frequency resolution)
   ```cpp
   w[n] = (0.42 - 0.5 * cos(2π * n/N) + 0.08 * cos(4π * n/N)) * 0.9999
   ```

## Implementation Details

### Class Structure

The implementation uses a template-based approach with a base `Window` class:

```cpp
template<typename QNumberType>
class Window {
    virtual QNumberType operator()(std::size_t n, std::size_t order) = 0;
};
```

Each specific window type inherits from this base class and implements its own windowing function.

### Type Safety

The implementation includes static type checking to ensure proper numeric types:
```cpp
static_assert(math::is_qnumber<QNumberType>::value ||
              std::is_floating_point<QNumberType>::value,
    "Window can only be instantiated with math::QNumber types.");
```

### Scaling Factor

All window functions include a 0.9999f scaling factor to prevent potential overflow in fixed-point arithmetic while maintaining high precision.

## Usage Guide

### Basic Usage

```cpp
// Create a window instance
HammingWindow<float> window;

// Apply window to a sample at position n in a sequence of length order
float windowedSample = signal[n] * window(n, order);
```

### Integration with FFT

When using windowing with FFT analysis:

```cpp
// Create window
HanningWindow<float> window;

// Apply window to input signal
for (std::size_t i = 0; i < N; ++i)
    input[i] *= window(i, N);

// Perform FFT
auto& frequencyDomain = fft.Forward(input);
```

## Window Selection Guide

Choose your window based on your application needs:

1. **Rectangular Window**
   - Use when: Signal is naturally periodic in the sample window
   - Best for: Separating frequencies that are far apart

2. **Hamming Window**
   - Use when: General spectral analysis
   - Best for: Balancing frequency resolution and spectral leakage

3. **Hanning Window**
   - Use when: General spectral analysis with emphasis on accuracy
   - Best for: Random signals and sinusoidal measurements

4. **Blackman Window**
   - Use when: Looking for small signals near strong ones
   - Best for: Applications requiring superior dynamic range

## Best Practices

1. **Window Selection**
   - Start with Hanning window for general applications
   - Use Rectangular only when signals are periodic in the window
   - Choose Blackman for high dynamic range requirements

2. **Signal Processing**
   - Apply window before FFT
   - Consider the window's effect on signal amplitude
   - Account for processing gain in measurements

3. **Performance**
   - Pre-compute window coefficients for repeated use
   - Consider using lookup tables for resource-constrained systems

## Common Applications

1. **Spectrum Analysis**
   - Frequency component identification
   - Power spectral density estimation
   - Harmonic analysis

2. **Digital Filtering**
   - FIR filter design
   - Filter bank implementation

3. **Audio Processing**
   - Short-time Fourier transform (STFT)
   - Speech analysis
   - Music processing
